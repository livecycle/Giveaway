### Giveaway Steps - With more details

1. **Install the Livecycle Docker Extension:**

   Visit this [link](https://hub.docker.com/extensions/livecycle/docker-extension) and install the Livecycle Docker Extension. Alternatively, search for `Livecycle` in the Docker Extension Marketplace. After installation and opening the extension, you will be prompted to sign in. Sign in using your GitHub or Google account.

2. **Run a Docker Compose application:**

   Run a Docker Compose application on your local machine.

3. **Share your local application:**

   Once your application is running, open the Livecycle Docker Extension. Upon opening the extension, you will see your running application. To share your application, toggle the "Shared" switch. This action will generate a public URL for your application for every service in your application. You can choose to share it publicly or privately.

   Then, click the "Invite" button and invite at least one other person to join your Livecycle "organization". This is a really important step!! 

5. **Share a picture:**

   Take a screenshot of your Livecycle org dashboard showing your app running and post it on X (AKA Twitter) by tagging [@get_livecycle](https://twitter.com/get_livecycle) and [@Docker](https://twitter.com/Docker).

   Even though the names of the people in your org don't show on this screen, we'll be able to verify it on our side.

   For reference, here's an example of the screen we want you to share:
