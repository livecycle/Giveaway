### What is Livecycle Docker Extension?

The Livecycle Docker Extension is a new tool that instantly shares your local development environment so others can review and give you feedback. It's great for ANY docker-compose compatible application you're working on.

### How you can enter the giveaway

To enter the giveaway, follow these steps:

- **STEP 1:** Follow [@get_livecycle](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=get_livecycle) + retweet the [giveaway post](https://x.com/get_livecycle/status/1724066281698013430?s=20).

- **STEP 2:** Use the [Livecycle Docker Extension](https://hub.docker.com/extensions/livecycle/docker-extension) like this:

  - **Install the extension:** The extension is available in the [Docker Extension Marketplace](https://hub.docker.com/extensions/livecycle/docker-extension). You can also look at our [docs](https://preevy.dev/integrations/docker-extension) to get started.

  - **Run a Docker Compose application:** Run a Docker Compose application which you would like to share with others using the Livecycle Docker Extension.

  - **Share your local application:** Once your application is running, open the Livecycle Docker Extension. Upon opening the extension, you will see your running application. To share your application, toggle the "Shared" switch. This action will generate a public URL for your application for every service in your application. You can choose to share it publicly or privately.

  - **Invite a friend:** Click the "Invite" button and invite at least one other person to join your Livecycle "organization".

- **STEP 3:** **Show us a screenshot** Share a screenshot of your [Livecycle org dashboard](https://app.livecycle.run/) on X (AKA Twitter) and tag @get_livecycle and @Docker.
