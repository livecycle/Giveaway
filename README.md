## Livecycle Docker Extension Giveaway

### What is Livecycle Docker Extension?

Livecycle Docker Extension allows you to instantly and securely share your local development environment and receive feedback much earlier in the development workflow, without the hassle of staging environments or CI builds.

### Giveaway Steps

- Follow [@get_livecycle](https://twitter.com/get_livecycle) + share this post

- Use [Livecycle Docker Extension](https://hub.docker.com/extensions/livecycle/docker-extension).

  - **Install the extension:** The extension is available in the [Docker Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Livecycle.livecycle-docker-extension) or you can install it directly from the [extension page](https://hub.docker.com/extensions/livecycle/docker-extension).

  - **Run a Docker Compose application:** Run a Docker Compose application to use with Livecycle Extension and share with others.

  - **Share your local application:** Once your application is running, open the Livecycle Docker Extension. Upon opening the extension, you will see your running application. To share your application, toggle the "Shared" switch. This action will generate a public URL for your application for every service in your application. You can choose to share it publicly or privately.

  - **Invite a friend:** Click the "Invite" button and invite at least one other person to join your Livecycle "organization".

  - **Share a screenshot** Share a screenshot of your Livecycle org dashboard on X (AKA Twitter) and tag @get_livecycle and @Docker. You can check out the [docs](https://preevy.dev/integrations/docker-extension) to learn how to access the dashboard.
